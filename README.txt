The purpose of the project was to get information from a WEB API and to create a local server and circulate information between them.
There is a server.js file. There is index.html, app.js and css.css files inside the website folder.

Most work done was in Javascript with some css and html. You can clone the project in your local gitHub desktop to tweak the code.
